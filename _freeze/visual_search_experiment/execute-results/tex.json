The experiment typically involves presenting participants with a\nvisual display, such as a picture or a computer screen, that contains a number\nof objects or stimuli. The participants are then asked to search for a specific\ntarget stimulus, such as a pink line, among the other stimuli in the display.\n\nDuring the experiment, the researcher may manipulate various factors, such as\nthe number of stimuli in the display, the similarity of the stimuli to the\ntarget, or the location of the target within the display. These manipulations\nallow the researcher to study how different factors affect the speed and\naccuracy of the participant's search for the target stimulus.\n\nOne of the most widely used manipulation in visual search experiment is the set\nsize, which is the number of stimuli in the display. The experimenter increases\nthe set size and observe how it affects the reaction time of the participants. \n\nAnother manipulation that is often used in visual search experiments is the\nsimilarity of the stimuli to the target. This can include manipulating the\ncolor, shape, or size of the stimuli to make them more or less similar to the\ntarget. The experimenter can observe how these manipulations affect the speed\nand accuracy of the participant's search for the target.\n\nThe visual search experiment is a powerful tool for studying the human visual\nsystem because it allows researchers to study how the brain processes and\nsearches for specific stimuli in a visual scene. \n\nOverall, visual search experiment is a widely used method in cognitive\npsychology to study how visual perception and attention work. It provides\nresearchers with a tool to investigate fundamental question about how we\nperceive and process visual information in the world around us.\n\n[@Wolfe:2008]\n\n# Experiment Setup\n\nWe will study how the reaction time changes as set size increases under\ndifferent circumstances. Specifically, the effects of set size, homogeneity\n(feature vs. conjunction) and target presence on reaction time will be examined.\nA total of N=3 participants will be recruited for the study. We then fit a\nlinear regression model predicting the reaction time based on the set size,\nsearch type and target presence. We will be interested in the coefficient in the\nlinear model corresponding to set size. We can think of the slope as giving us a\nmeasure of how much does the reaction time increase, if we increase the set size\nby 1.  This will be our measure of efficiency.\n\nThe experiment will consist of 300 trials, in which participants will be\npresented with an image containing a set of lines with different orientations\n(either ``/`` or ``\\``). The participants will be instructed to search for a\npink line with an orientation of ``/`` and indicate whether it is present or\nabsent. The trials will vary in set size (10, 20, 30, or 40) and search type\n(feature or conjunction). In _feature search_, the image will contain only lines\nof a single color (lines with orientation ``\\`` act as distractors), while in\n_conjunction search_, the image will contain a mixture of blue and pink lines\n(blue lines and pink lines with orientation ``\\`` act as distractors).\nParticipants will be provided with feedback on the accuracy of their responses\nand encouraged to respond as quickly as possible. The estimated duration of the\nexperiment is approximately 15-20 minutes.\n\nThe participants consisted of students in age range 20-25 years old. Both\ngenders were represented. The participants were seated in front of a 14-inch\nmonitor with 1920x1080 resolution and instructed to make themselves comfortable.\nNo training trials were conducted prior to the experiment. No participant needed\nto take a break during the experiment.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell tbl-cap='Sample of the input data.' execution_count=4}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=13}\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{tabular}{lrlrllr}\n\\toprule\n{} &  participant &  present &  set\\_size &  conjuction &  correct &    rt \\\\\n\\midrule\n0 &            1 &     True &        30 &        True &     True &  2975 \\\\\n1 &            1 &     True &        20 &        True &     True &   713 \\\\\n2 &            1 &    False &        20 &        True &     True &  1641 \\\\\n3 &            1 &    False &        30 &       False &     True &  2071 \\\\\n4 &            1 &    False &        10 &        True &     True &  1064 \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n# Results\n\nFirstly, in @tbl-accuracy we report the accuracy (percentage of errors for each\nparticipant).

The visual salience of the target in feature search\nleads to it immediately capturing our attention as it drastically differs from\nits surroundings. Conversely, the presence of distractors results in several\nsimilar items attracting our attention, which necessitates the examination of\nmore items, thereby leading to an increase in reaction time, which agrees with\nour observations.\n\nNext we address the difference in slope for the target absent trials.  In target\npresent trials, it is generally necessary to examine roughly half of the set\nsize items until the target is found.  However, in the absence of the target,\nthe participant must spend more time examining the objects in search of a\ntarget, which results in an increase in reaction time, which is consistent with\nour observations.\n\n# References\n\n",
